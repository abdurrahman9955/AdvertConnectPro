         <p className='p-5'>
         At AdvertConnectPro, we are committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and compliant environment 
         for all users. To ensure the integrity of our platform and uphold our community standards, we enforce 
         strict rules and regulations governing user conduct and content. Here's how we handle violations of 
         these rules:</p>

         <p className='text-xl pt-5 px-5 max-md:text-xl'>Warning System:</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         First Offense: In the event of a user violating our rules or regulations for the first time, we believe 
         in providing an opportunity for education and correction. As such, the user will receive a formal warning 
         message sent to their notification inbox and registered email address. This warning serves as a 
         notification of the violation and a reminder of our platform's guidelines.</p>

         <p className='text-xl pt-5 px-5 max-md:text-xl'>Suspension or Account Removal:</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         Subsequent Offenses: If a user persists in violating our rules and regulations despite receiving a 
         warning, further action will be taken. For repeated offenses, typically occurring three times, 
         the user's account will be subject to suspension or removal from our database. This decision is made to 
         maintain the integrity of our community and deter future violations.</p>

         <p className='text-xl pt-5 px-5 max-md:text-xl'>Preventing Access:</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         Credential Prevention: In addition to account suspension or removal, we take measures to prevent the 
         user from accessing our platform using the same credentials, such as email or phone number. By blocking 
         access to their credentials, we aim to prevent further misuse of our platform and protect the user 
         community from potential harm.</p>

         <p className='text-xl pt-5 px-5 max-md:text-xl'>Content Guidelines:</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         Prohibited Content: Users are strictly prohibited from uploading or promoting any content that violates 
         our guidelines, including but not limited to explicit or graphic material, hate speech, illegal 
         activities, or prohibited products. Content that breaches our guidelines will be promptly removed, 
         and the user will be notified of the violation and consequences.</p>

         <p className='text-xl pt-5 px-5 max-md:text-xl'>Profile Maintenance:</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         Ideal Profile: User profiles must adhere to our standards of decency and professionalism. This includes 
         refraining from uploading inappropriate or explicit content, such as naked photos or related images. 
         Profiles found to contain such content will be subject to removal or suspension until the issue is 
         resolved.</p>

         <p className='text-xl pt-5 px-5 max-md:text-xl'>Appeals Process:</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         Appeal Option: We understand that mistakes can happen, and users may wish to appeal a decision regarding 
         their account status. To facilitate this, we provide an appeals process where users can submit a formal 
         request for review of their case. Our team will assess the appeal and respond accordingly, taking into 
         consideration the circumstances of the violation and any mitigating factors presented by the user.</p>

         <p className='p-5'>
         By enforcing these rules and regulations with diligence and fairness, we strive to create a welcoming 
         and secure environment for all users of AdvertConnectPro. We appreciate your cooperation in upholding 
         our community standards and contributing to a positive user experience. If you have any questions or 
         concerns regarding our enforcement policies, please do not hesitate to contact us 
         at advertconnectpro@gmail.com for further assistance.</p>
